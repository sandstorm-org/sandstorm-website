Getting On Zulip
----------------

We are officially moving the chat portion of the Sandstorm Community to [Zulip](https://sandstorm.zulipchat.com).

You don't need to install an app to join, though you can. You don't even need to log in to see what's happening. Take a look!

If you are still on Matrix, or especially if you are on IRC, we invite you to move over. Zulip will be a great way to collaborate at a faster pace than on the mailing list.

Important announcements will go on our mailing lists, and you are still encouraged to continue to use them for questions if you prefer it over chat.

### A little history:

The Sandstorm project (long before the community fork) was originally on IRC. First Freenode, and then Libera.Chat.

We bridged Libera.Chat room to Matrix, and over time people started switching to Matrix.

The Libera.Chat bridge stopped working. We assumed (incorrectly) that IRC people had all moved over. Furthermore, people were unable to join the room, and we didn't notice this for about a year.

We are frankly not in love with Matrix in the first place, purely a personal preference.

We heard about Zulip, tried it out. It's a bit to get used to, but overall we like it. We decided to make the switch.

### Why Zulip?

Zulip conversations are organized into Channels and Topics. A Topic corresponds roughly to a "thread" in other chat apps, except that they are mandatory. That is, every post in a Channel has to be on a certain Topic. You can view a Channel as a whole or focus on a given Topic. This takes a little getting used to, but it keeps things organized.

If discussion in a thread starts to drift into a different subject, an admin can move those posts to a new appropriate Topic. Similarly Topics can be moved to a more appropriate Channel. This keeps us focused.

Channels can be made public and searchable on the web. Specific conversations are linkable (see below link). As with mailing lists, this is very useful for an open source project. One example is linking from a Github conversation.

Not to mention, Zulip is just snappy. It's not bulky like Slack or Matrix. We find all these features conducive to having productive conversations. This is where we can "get in the weeds" and work things out.

They're also great to work with. Zulip is a company, but they offer free hosting to FOSS projects such as ours. They responded [overnight to a bug report](TODO). (By contrast we reached out to Matrix for help with the bridge and we never heard back).

So, thank you to Zulip. We understand that they are a business and we appreciate the free hosting. Please give them a look.

#### Downsides:

Arguably a bit annoying that you have to make a separate account (like Slack) for every community, even on the same server.
The need to make a Topic for every message is a bit to get used to. We have "off topic"/"water cooler" threads for catch-all.
