*Hi, my name is [Dan](https://danielkrol.com). This is my first time posting on the Sandstorm blog. I learned about Sandstorm almost a decade ago. I was interested in resiliency and was looking at easy self-hosting solutions. I thought it would be really cool to run Sandstorm "off the grid", even on a mesh network. We have a lot of applications easy to install, but I thought it would be cool to bring easy hosting of Wikipedia and other open data to Sandstorm, so I packaged an application called [Kiwix](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/5uh349d0kky2zp5whrh2znahn27gwha876xze3864n0fu9e5220h) (which is an awesome project [in its own right](https://kiwix.org)).*

*As I was wrapping up with that, I decided that some day I would do the same for [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org). But unlike with Kiwix, I needed to create a new application. Years later, here we are.*

Introducing Desert Atlas
------------------------

Sandstorm, meet OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap, meet Sandstorm.

[Desert Atlas](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/e5eaqnrqfrhgax1awtgw9uqayg42kcen2gkpynjs3j5mww7w3rp0) is the world map for Sandstorm. With Desert Atlas, you can privately collaborate with friends to search for destinations and save them as bookmarks for use on the go.

You may be familiar with OpenStreetMap applications for your phone such as Organic Maps that preserve privacy by downloading entire regions of the map at once and performing all other actions locally. Desert Atlas was inspired by this model. Unlike many OpenStreetMap web applications, the map regions are fully hosted in your grain, and downloaded with the same ease of point-and-click that you expect from Sandstorm. Unlike Organic Maps, Desert Atlas also allows you to easily share your map with a friend and plan a trip together, all on a private server that you trust.

When you're ready to take your map on the road, Desert Atlas its also a companion for Organic Maps and OsmAnd. You can export your bookmarks from your sandstorm grain to your OSM app on your phone and navigate privately.

This has been the result of quite a bit of effort on my part, including learning more about the OpenStreetMap ecosystem I'd never thought I would. But since I had to learn a lot of things, I didn't learn them very deeply. If you're inspired by this project and have deeper knowledge about some of its components, I've listed some low hanging fruit at the end of this post where you might be able to make a big impact pretty easily.

The gap between Organic Maps and Google Maps
--------------------------------------------

Organic Maps allows you to search for destinations, navigate, and create bookmarks that can be imported or exported as [kml files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language). It does all of these on your phone without hitting the network. The one concession to privacy is that the map data has to come from somewhere. The underlying map regions need to be downloaded initially, and updated periodically. Organic Maps' server knows what regions you're downloading, but they're each roughly the size of a small country, and it happens maybe once a week. This gives them much lower resolution than, say, requesting a specific intersection on demand from a centralized map website.

Arrows in either direction indicate import/export of bookmarks from Organic Maps phone app and unspecified means of sharing with friends."](/news/images/desert-atlas-diagram-organic-maps.png)

But what if you want to share the location of an event with a friend? Exporting and sending bookmark files is a bit inconvenient, especially if you're collaborating. Organic Maps actually has a feature for easily sharing locations with a friend, but it uses their website, which means you'll be revealing the specific location to Organic Maps' server. For collaboration, you might find yourself using a different centalized service (Google Maps comes to mind but there are OSM-based options), even if you export the results to your Organic Maps app.

This is where a private web app comes in handy. It sits on the Internet, which is less secure than Organic Maps, so you may not want to use it for everything. But if you trust the server, it can still be private. You can share it with chosen friends, and plan together if you want. When you're done, you can each export it Organic Maps for navigation, and better convenience and security.

For comparison, I've looked at a couple other options for self-hosted OSM. I haven't taken the time to try them out in depth, so apologies if I get something wrong.

[Facilmap](https://yunohost.org/en/app_facilmap) for YunoHost and [Nextcloud Maps](https://github.com/nextcloud/maps) are made to be easy to set up and have similar use cases to Desert Atlas. They let you bookmark, plan trips, and share the results, all privately. But rather than downloading regions like Organic Maps, [they get underlying map data from and sends search terms to](https://github.com/nextcloud/maps/issues/733) third-party services (such as openstreetmap.org), which [leaks some](https://docs.facilmap.org/users/privacy/#layers) usage information.

[Headway](https://about.maps.earth/) is a project that solves this privacy problem. It installs the "full stack" of self-hosted OSM relatively easily. As you'll see below, the OSM ecosystem has a lot going on, and Headway simplifies things quite a bit. However, it uses Docker, which (in the humble opinion of Sandstorm fans) is still not as simple as Sandstorm. (I have seen a little discussion about porting it to YunoHost, but it hasn't happened as of now).

Desert Atlas takes a much more stripped down approach than Headway. Built for Sandstorm, with a lot fewer moving parts. I'm not aware of any other offering that is quite as easy to spin up (thanks to Sandstorm), lets you point and click to download the regions you need, allows you to collaborate with friends, and gives you this level of privacy.

The Simplest Version of Everything
----------------------------------

So how does this actually work? I kept it simple, which is not to say easy! The implementation wasn't that hard. The hard part was finding which tools to use and how to intergrate them. All the heavy lifting was already implemented by those tools. Big thanks to all those who created them.

OpenStreetMap is, among other things, a canonical database representing the world map. It's openly available and editable like Wikipedia. OSM applications such as Desert Atlas need to download this data in one way or another. Application creators usually provide their own copy of the data in a custom format that their apps download. They also use their own servers to spare the resources of openstreetmap.org. OpenStreetMap provides periodic snapshots of their data as one giant protobuf file that application creators can download to make periodic snapshots of the data available to their users.

In general, the two parts of the OSM app experience are tiles and search.

### Tile format

The traditional OpenStreetMap stack includes a tile server which imports the raw protobuf data into a postrgres database and generates a grid of square png files for every zoom level. Postgres is hard to get running on Sandstorm because it's made to be multi-user (though at one point I actually got a tile server to run and generate tiles in a test environment!). Alternately, as the provider of the map data for the app, I could have taken the path of pre-generating the png files for the app to download, but I suspect the resulting file size would be massive.

Then one day on Hacker News I saw something called [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com). It's a project for vector-based tiles that render in the browser. It uses a file format called pmtiles. A single pmtiles file represents a region of the map at all zoom levels. You can use [protomaps.js](https://github.com/protomaps/protomaps-leaflet) along with the [Leaflet UI framework](http://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) to view it. As you scroll or zoom, it makes range requests for the specific subset of the file that it needs to display it. No need for a database, or to generate anything within the Sandstorm app. Each downloadable region of the map has one pmtiles file.

And how do we create these pmtiles files? I didn't want to regularly copy the entire world map from protomaps.com. I set out to generate them myself from raw OSM data. The best way I could find was to first convert them to another vector format called mbtiles using a tool called [tilemaker](https://github.com/systemed/tilemaker/), and then from mbtiles to pmtiles using [go-pmtiles](https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles) from the Protomaps project.

### Tile Schema

I generated my first pmtiles file and... nothing showed up. It turns out that on top of tile file formats, there's a concept of a *schema*. Protomaps.js turns out to have its own schema. Tilemaker uses a lua script to determine the schema of the mbtiles file it creates. The default lua script that comes with tilemaker is based on the OpenMapTiles schema. I initially set out to start with this lua script and edit it until the data looked like the Protomaps schema. However, I was a little nervous because I was advised that OpenMapTiles has an uncertain intellectual property situation. I may or may not have misunderstood or overreacted, but at any rate I had an alternative. The folks at Geofabrik created their own schema called [Shortbread](https://github.com/shortbread-tiles/shortbread-docs) that is licensed CC0 and comes with its own lua script for tilemaker. To steer clear of any concern over IP issues in creating my lua script to generate files in the Protomaps.js schema, I started from Shortbread.

### Search Data

The standard option for an OpenStreetMap search service is called [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/). It uses ElasticSearch under the hood, which again is a bit heavy duty for Sandstorm. I asked myself, "what is the sqlite of search?" It turns out the answer is... sqlite! There's a [plugin called fts5](https://sqlite.org/fts5.html) that performs reasonably well on Desert Atlas for searching names in the database. Desert Atlas does not yet support address search, so it remains to be seen whether fts5 can be used for that.

To generate the search database, I [decide what I want to extract](https://github.com/orblivion/desert-atlas/blob/658b5f3fb4fbd5dc86d2c4cf27b3a7d1200cba6f/generate-data/extract_search.py) from the raw protobuf for a given region using [pyosmium](https://osmcode.org/pyosmium/). The result is saved to a CSV that gets bundled with the pmtiles file for the same region. When a user downloads a region inside Desert Atlas, the CSV is imported into the grain's sqlite search database.

In addition to searching within downloaded regions, I decided that it would be useful to have cities and large towns built into the app so that the user can jump to their city by searching *before* they download any regions. This makes it easier for users to orient themselves and find which region they want to download. For this part, I used a pre-baked non-OSM database called GeoNames(http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/) as a shortcut.

### Splitting the world

Organic Maps is generally split by "administrative region". It could be a country, state, or metro area, depending on how dense the information is. Ideally Desert Atlas would work the same way.

There's a service called Geofabrik that offers up-to-date raw OSM protobuf data split by regions in such a way. However, they have a download rate limit that I decided was prohibitive for this purpose, so I sought out to download OSM's `planet.osm.pbf` and split it myself. Geofabrik also has a publicly available geojson file that defines the regions they offer for download, which I could in principle use to do the same splitting myself. However, the exact process that they use to slice the planet with this json file is not publicly available. In the long run I would like to figure this out.

For now, I found a "good enough" shortcut and I decided to take it. I split `planet.osm.pbf` using a tool called [splitter](https://www.mkgmap.org.uk/doc/splitter.html) from mkgmap. This tool splits raw OSM data into rectangles targeting a maximum raw data size per region. Unfortunately the render and search extractions done for Desert Atlas do not correspond 1:1 with the raw data, so the downloadable regions in Desert Atlas vary quite a bit in size, but I am shooting for about the same region size as Organic Maps.

### UI

This part was straightforward. As mentioned above, I used Leaflet, which is the go-to web UI framework for OpenStreetMap. It's extensible and worked well for me. I also used a plugin called [Leaflet-Search](https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-search) that I was able to connect to the simple Python based backend and query the sqlite database. 

### So, in a nutshell...

Periodic map generation process (currently ~2.5 days)
* Download `planet.osm.pbf` (world map raw protobuf)
* plant.osm.pbf -> rectangular region osm.pbf files (using splitter from mkgmap)
* each region osm.pbf -> region .pmtiles with protomaps schema (using tilemaker and go-protomaps, with thanks to Geofabrik for the shortbread schema)
* each region osm.pbf -> region .csv with search data (using pyosmium)
* each region .pmtiles + .csv -> region .tar.gz -> upload to S3

On the user's Sandstorm server, each grain is pre-loaded with large towns thanks to data taken from GeoNames. It downloads whichever regions the user asks for. For each region, the pmtiles file is ready to use as-is by protomaps.js and Leaflet, and the search CSV file is imported into the sqlite+fts5 search database, with Leaflet-Search providing the UI.

Getting involved
----------------

If you're an OSM developer, you may be facepalming right now. But you also know that OSM has a big, confusing ecosystem, with many ways of doing the same thing. This was my first exposure to a lot of it. This was a lot of work, and I wanted to forge a reasonable but efficient path to a minimum viable product.

It's a modest submission of a usable proof of concept. I didn't spend much time getting hung up on finding the very best way of doing everything on the first try, but at this point I'm wide open to improvements, including replacing any part of this with something better.

I've [identified some areas](https://github.com/orblivion/desert-atlas/wiki/Where-to-help) that I think could be low hanging fruit, especially for people who can teach me about areas I'm less famailar with (tiles, search, UI, front end) or just general improvements (rewriting the server in Go). Hit me up if you'd like to help!
