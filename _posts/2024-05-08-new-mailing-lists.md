title: "New Mailing Lists for Sandstorm"

Several of us have long talked about how to get away from Google Groups and when to do
so. Google has not gotten better at managing spam both in terms of junk registrations
and emails, as well as recently flagging one of our core community member's posts as
spam more than once, despite them being here for several years. There's also the
fundamental risk Google shutters or substantially alters Groups, and of course, it
always seems a bit odd to ask users of a privacy-centered project to sign up with Google. 

We've decided to launch new mailing lists using [groups.io][1], a service founded by the
original developer of Yahoo! Groups before it was acquired. It's a solid platform with a
very generous free tier and feature set. The service has been running since 2014 and the
founder started making mailing list software in 1998, so the likelihood of stability and
longevity here seems pretty high. It has some pleasant features on their site, but like
any good traditional mailing list software, can handle pretty much everything you can
want entirely over email. 

As we are focused on ethical practices and solid trust relationships, we are not opting
anyone into the new mailing lists automatically. The individuals who subscribed to the
Google Groups list did so in order to follow Sandstorm.io or Kenton, not necessarily us.
Therefore, everyone does need to sign themselves up, and the lists will have a somewhat
smaller reach, at least at first.

There have often been questions about whether people could bring general questions or
support requests to a "dev" list, so we've decided that instead of having a single list,
we would have a more general list for users, and a dev list for people who hack on and
build apps for and want to talk about code for Sandstorm. Feel free to join both, or just
one if you are interested in a few less emails.

[sandstorm-user-group][2] - For community and project announcements, general discussion,
and support

[sandstorm-dev-group][3] - For discussion of app and platform development

Finally, we have a third group for business users which is semi-private, to discuss how
Sandstorm can meet enterprise needs and hopefully how the Sandstorm project can develop a
healthy relationship with business users while remaining a very non-profit, very open
source outlook. If you use Sandstorm in an enterprise environment, or are building a
business around Sandstorm, please [email me][4] for an invitation.
